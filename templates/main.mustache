	<h2>Alpha Release</h2>
	<p>Model systems are the cornerstone of biomedical research to investigate biological processes, test gene-based disease hypotheses, and develop and test disease treatments. The vast knowledge that we have about model systems can be better utilized if semantically aggregated and made queryable based on any number of facets, such as phenotypic similarity, network analysis, gene expression and function, and genomics. The Monarch Initiative aims to provide easy-to-use tools to navigate this data landscape, services for other resources, and educational outreach regarding the production of structured data for biomedical discovery.</p>
