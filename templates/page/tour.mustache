                            Model systems are the cornerstone of biomedical research for
                            understanding of biological processes, testing gene-based disease
                            hypotheses, and developing and testing disease treatments.

                        <div class="text">
                            There are a wide-variety of model databases that contain
                            unparalleled content about genetics, genomics, anatomy,
                            environmental interactions, and developmental processes.
                            However, clinical and translational researchers face a daunting
                            challenge in using these vast stores of biomedical data to
                            inform their understanding of human disease mechanisms that
                            drives new therapies. This is particularly difficult in the
                            context of rare or undiagnosed diseases, where their data is
                            limited to descriptive phenotypic data and numerous candidate
                            genomic variations.

                            Currently, tools that exploit similarities between phenotypes,
                            organisms, and human diseases that leverage these rich data are
                            in their infancy or are non-existent. To address this challenge,
                            the Monarch Initiative Discovery System contains a wealth of
                            information about model organisms, in vitro models, genes,
                            pathways, gene expression, protein and genetic interactions,
                            orthology, disease, phenotypes, publications, and authors.
