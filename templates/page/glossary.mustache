                            <b>Linked Open Data (LOD)</b> - Linked open data is about providing data links to computers in the same way human users have access to links in web pages. The Web has mostly been in the form of “Linked Open Pages” where web pages are created for human readers and the pages contain links to other pages with related content. The basic idea is that there is some content and a standard form/syntax for linking the content (hyperlinks in web pages). LOD is trying to do the same for structured data so that computers, applications, or algorithms can navigate the structured data to find what they need the same way humans navigate web pages. The “Open” means that the data is public but it doesn’t have to be that way. Data could be linked without it being public. This is similar to how users browsing the web are prompted for a login when they follow a restricted web page.&nbsp;(For more info see: <a href="http://linkeddata.org/">http://linkeddata.org/</a>)<br>

                            <b>Semantic Web</b> - With the above description of LOD in mind, the term “Semantic Web” includes LOD and semantics. The “semantics” is way for giving meaning to the LOD. This is done by creating a schema (specification, dictionary, types, etc.) that is used to describe the data in LOD. This will then allow an application to navigate the LOD to search for a specific “type” of information. To relate this to the “Linked Open Pages” analogy: when a human user navigates to a web page that contains a word that they are not familiar with, the user can consult a dictionary to understand the meaning of the word. One of the goals of the Semantic Web is to address the same problem at the computational level. The “Web” in the term is referring to the Web. The idea is that LOD and the semantics should be accessible on the Web the same way pages are. It also means that the current Web of pages should be linked to LOD and semantics whenever possible so that a computer (Google for example) is able to better understand the content of a web page or some other structured data. (For more info see: <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/">http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/</a>).<br>

                            <b>Resource Description Framework (RDF)</b> - RDF is a technical standard that defines how data and semantics should be structured and represented in order for it to be available as LOD on the Semantic Web. The standard has many technical details. However, the basic principle is that data is represented in the form of triples. A triple is a brief statement in the form of a subject, a predicate or relationship, and an object. Also, every item in a triple has a unique identifier so that a set of triples that describe a subject, or use an object to describe subjects, can be related to each other through this unique identifier in order to form a single graph of relationships between all the data. The unique identifiers are in the form of a URLs (web links) and this is how the idea of “linked” data is implemented in LOD.

                            <b>Triple Store</b> - A triple store is an application that is able to store and retrieve RDF. It is similar to a relational database (think Oracle or MS Access databases) but for RDF-based data.&nbsp;(For more info see: <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/positions/rusher.html">http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/positions/rusher.html</a>)<br>

                            <b>Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)</b> - Is a technical specification for how to create and interpret the identifiers that are used in the Semantic Web and LOD. It is related to the standard for hyperlinks in web pages but it generalizes that idea and clarifies few issues related to the formatting and allowed characters.
