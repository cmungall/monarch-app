                            Chuck is a programmer on a wide range of projects (e.g. FaceBase,
                            Monarch, Ontology for Craniofacial Development and Malformations)
                            in the Department of Biomedical Informatics. His responsibilities
                            include leading the FaceBase development team and providing
                            technical solutions on other projects. In the past, Chuck led
                            the development of the Resource Discovery System (RDS) an
                            application tracking 1500 scientific resources from several
                            NIH research programs.

                            Dr. Robinson has a BA in Mathematics as well as an MSC. in
                            computer science from Columbia University, and an MD from
                            University of Pennsylvania. He has been working as a clinician
                            and a research at the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin,
                            Germany, since 1996, and has obtained certification (“Facharzt”)
                            in pediatrics, as well as a Habilitation (“Privatdozent”) in
                            Human Genetics. He is currently Professor for Medical Genomics
                            at the Charité and leads a mixed group of bioinformaticians,
                            biologists, and MDs. Much of Peter’s work has involved the
                            development of computational resources and algorithms for the
                            study of human hereditary diseases, including the development
                            of the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) as well as the bioinformatics
                            analysis of next-generation sequencing data including exome,
                            genome, RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, and TCR sequencing experiments.
                            Recent wetlab highlights include the identification of the
                            disease genes CA8, PIGV, PIGO, and PGAP2 as well as the
                            development of a novel therapy for Marfan syndrome based on
                            inhibition of a class of GxxPG-containing fragments of the
                            extracellular matrix.
